Many people still have a 'Middle Earth' view of New Zealand derived from the _Lord of the Rings_ movies. In that context Auckland comes as a surprise to many being a rapidly growing city, built on 'California sprawl' lines, and with a hyperdiverse population, over 40% of whom are foreign-born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Māori are the population indigenous to New Zealand before European arrival in the 19th century. At that time the Māori population was massively reduced as a result of war, disease, along with the usual post-colonial ills. However, since the 1980s there has been a strong renaissance, with Māori having a more recognized place in the political and cultural constitution of Aotearoa/New Zealand than is the case in other settler-colonial societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large Pasifika population reflects Auckland's place as 'the capital of Polynesia', with more people of Pacific Island heritage than anywhere in the world, with the possible exception of Los Angeles (a metropolis 12 to 15 times more populous).  See for example, this footage of crowds of native-born Samoan and Tongan Aucklanders greeting the arrival of the Samoan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NABfXFHumHg) and Tongan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyu646wHw08) rugby teams before the 2011 Rugby World Cup.  Pasifika have been a substantial presence in Auckland since the 1950s when many arrived as 'guest workers'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Māori and Pasifika populations remain substantially over-represented among New Zealand's poorest communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, Auckland, in common with many Pacific Rim cities (including in California) has seen the rapid growth of large immigrant communities from across Asia, but especially East Asia. Auckland's Asian population is economically diverse, and still dominated by first-generation migrants, many of whom were born overseas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the US, the 'Asian' population category is ridiculously broad, including South Asian (i.e. India-Pakistan), Chinese, and East Asian (Korea, Vietnam, etc.)  How race and ethnicity are defined in census terms is a vexed question, that varies from place to place.  For our present purpose, of note, as already mentioned, is that Māori and Pasifika populations in New Zealand are more socioeconomically challenged than the population in general, and that the Asian population are more likely to be recent immigrants than other segments of the population."
