See for example, this footage of crowds of Aucklanders greeting the arrival of the Samoan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NABfXFHumHg) and Tongan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyu646wHw08) rugby teams before the 2011 Rugby World Cup in Auckland.

For our present purpose, of note is that Māori and Pasifika populations in New Zealand are more socioeconomically challenged than the population in general, and that the Asian population are more likely to be recent immigrants than other segments of the population."
